# APIBasedUi

Android Sary app that demonstrates the architecture, tools and guidelines that I use when developing for the Android platform.
This app was built using a clean architecture with MVVM for the presentation layer.

# About the app

UI of the app is created based on the API data provided.

I used clean architecture based on MVVM and kotlin corotunies, flow and LiveData with Retrofit to get the data from the APIs.
