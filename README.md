# APIBasedUi

Android Sary app that demonstrates the architecture, tools and guidelines that I use when developing for the Android platform.
This app was built using a clean architecture with MVVM for the presentation layer.

# About the app

## Introduction

The app is a demo and UI of the app is created based on the API provided data.

## Architecture and components

I used clean architecture based on MVVM and kotlin corotunies, flow and LiveData with Retrofit to get the data from the APIs.

## Multilingual

This app is also multilingual, right now it is only for English and Arabic based on default mobile language settings.
